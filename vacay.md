## Points of Interest
1. Paia (town) - North Maui - A great surfer town for walking, eating, shopping boutiques. Don't let the small town fool you, *Mama's Fish House* is just down the road; one of Maui's top restaurants. Another half-mile down the road is the best beachside turtle watching on the island.
2. Lahaina- "Front Street") - Great old town for walking, eating, enjoying life. The town has a great night life, and there are plenty of touristy things to do. Don't miss the huge (*and that's an understatement)* Banyan tree in the middle of town. 
3. Big Beach- The name gives it away, but this place is what you picture when you think of a big endless beautiful Hawaiian Beach.
